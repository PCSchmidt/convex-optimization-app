questions:
  - question: "What property guarantees that a local optimum is also a global optimum in convex optimization?"
    options:
      - "Convex objective and feasible set"
      - "Non-linear constraints"
      - "Random initialization"
    answer: "Convex objective and feasible set"
    explanation: "Convexity ensures any local minimum is also global."
  - question: "Which algorithm is commonly used to solve linear programs?"
    options:
      - "Simplex method"
      - "Gradient descent"
      - "Newton's method"
    answer: "Simplex method"
    explanation: "The simplex method is a standard technique for linear programming."
  - question: "What does the feasible set represent in an optimization problem?"
    options:
      - "All points satisfying the constraints"
      - "The gradient of the objective function"
      - "Only the optimal solutions"
    answer: "All points satisfying the constraints"
    explanation: "The feasible set contains every point that meets all constraints."
